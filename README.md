# Zero Deployable Backend

This is a [zero](https://github.com/commitdev/zero) module which sets up a
service which can be deployed to the environment set up with [zero-aws-eks-stack](https://github.com/commitdev/zero-aws-eks-stack).
It also contains a simple CircleCI pipeline which defines how to build and deploy the service.

### Frontend Repo
